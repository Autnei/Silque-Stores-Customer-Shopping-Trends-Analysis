# Silque-Stores-Customer-Shopping-Trends-Analysis
This project involved analyzing sales data from Silque Stores to identify patterns in customer behavior and purchasing trends throughout 2020. By examining product categories, payment methods, shipping options, and seasonal trends, I was able to pinpoint the top-performing products and so on.

The following observations and recommendations were derived from the analysis:

**KEY INSIGHTS**

Top Category: The best-performing product category was clothing, with 1,737 purchases, followed by accessories at 1,240. The least-performing category was Outerwear, with 324 purchases.

Seasonal Performance: Fall was the strongest season in terms of total purchases, generating $60,018 in sales. The weakest season was summer, with a dip in sales to $55,777. However, sales began to recover in winter, reaching $58,607.

Customer Demographics: Most of the store's customers were male, accounting for 68% of the total customer base, while females made up 32%.

Payment Methods: PayPal was the most commonly used payment method, with 677 purchases, followed by Credit Cards and Cash, which accounted for 671 and 670 purchases, respectively. Bank Transfer was the least used method, with only 612 purchases.

Shipping Preferences: Free shipping was the most popular shipping option, utilized in 675 purchases, while 2-day shipping was the least preferred, with 627 uses.

Locations: Montana led in total purchases, generating $5,784 in sales. Illinois, California, and Idaho followed closely, with over $5,500 in sales each. On the other hand, states like West Virginia and North Dakota generated lower sales.

Ratings and Reviews: Most customers rated their purchases at 3.4 stars, with the highest concentration of reviews falling between 3.4 and 4.6 stars.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

Continue expanding the clothing category with new styles and exclusive collections. Use promotions and bundles to maintain popularity, and analyze why clothing outperformed to improve weaker categories like outerwear.

Focus on fall marketing with special collections and discounts. Launch campaigns for winter and spring to offset summer sales dips.

While male customers are the majority, efforts should be made to engage more female shoppers through targeted marketing, promotions, and products catering to their preferences.

Maintain free shipping and expand coverage to boost satisfaction. Offer incentives for Express and 2-day shipping to diversify options.

Incentivize alternative payment methods like Bank Transfer and Venmo to reduce dependence on PayPal and improve convenience.

Focus on improving product quality and customer service. Consider gathering feedback from customers who leave low ratings and addressing common complaints, whether it's related to shipping, product quality, or support. Encourage customers to leave reviews, especially those likely to leave high ratings.
